# Housing Prices Prediction
This project aims to predict housing prices using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing various features such as area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more, our models provide accurate estimates of housing prices. We have employed a range of regression algorithms, including Stochastic Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, to build predictive models. The models were trained on a dataset consisting of 545 samples, each with 12 predictors. Through extensive evaluation using cross-validation techniques, we have ensured the robustness and generalization ability of our models. The final Stochastic Gradient Boosting model emerged as the top performer, achieving a root mean squared error (RMSE) of approximately 1,073,395, and an R-squared value of approximately 0.678. To facilitate easy deployment and integration into applications, we have implemented a Plumber API, allowing users to make predictions on new housing data effortlessly. Whether you're a real estate agent, property investor, or homeowner, our predictive models offer valuable insights into housing market trends and pricing dynamics.
